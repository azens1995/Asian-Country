# Asian-Country
This project shows the name, captial, region, population, area and native name of the Asian countries.

This project was made during the learning process of the Retrofit2 for using REST API.

In this project, followings are used.
1. Retrofit2: For the network connection and to call the REST API.
2. RecyclerView: To show the list of the countries

This uses the http://restcountries.eu/ api to retrieve the details about the countries.

Known Issue: 
I was not able to show the flags of each countries due to issue in showing svg files from the server.
